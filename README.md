# Cat-Clicker

[Cat Clicker](http://abustamam.github.io/Cat-Clicker) was my first project. 

## version 0.1

Has one single cat. It was very easy to set up, just getting the structure of the HTML page I need to get used to. 

I feel pretty good about my code, even though it's not "beautiful."

I clicked my cat probably 10 times to test functionality. 

## version 0.2

Since the HTML skeleton is already available for me, I merely dumped both cats into a `#cats div` and added a class for each cat. 

I still feel good about my code, though it's still not beautiful. 

Clicked probably another 10 times to test functionality.
